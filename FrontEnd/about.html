      <p class="lead mt-4">
        LostAndFound is a platform dedicated to reuniting lost items with their
        rightful owners. Every year, millions of items are lost, and many of
        them go unclaimed simply because there isn't a central place to report
        or search for lost items. Our platform aims to solve that problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand the distress and inconvenience that comes with losing
        something valuable. That's why we've made it our mission to provide an
        easy-to-use platform where people can post about items they've found or
        search for items they've lost. Our hope is that through community effort
        and the power of technology, more people will be able to find their lost
        belongings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team is dedicated to ensuring that LostAndFound remains a safe and
        trustworthy platform. We encourage users to practice safe exchanges and
        to meet in public places when returning items to their owners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for being a part of our community. Together, we can make a
        difference and help return lost items to their rightful owners.
      </p>
